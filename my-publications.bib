  abstract = {This work investigates how the sound field created by a sound reinforcement system can be controlled at low frequencies. An indoor control method is proposed which actively absorbs the sound incident on a reflecting boundary using an array of secondary sources. The sound field is separated into incident and reflected components by a microphone array close to the secondary sources, enabling the minimization of reflected components by means of optimal signals for the secondary sources. The method is purely feed-forward and assumes constant room conditions. Three different sound field separation techniques for the modeling of the reflections are investigated based on plane wave decomposition, equivalent sources, and the Spatial Fourier transform. Simulations and an experimental validation are presented, showing that the control method performs similarly well at enhancing low frequency responses with the three sound separation techniques. Resonances in the entire room are reduced, although the microphone array and secondary sources are confined to a small region close to the reflecting wall. Unlike previous control methods based on the creation of a plane wave sound field, the investigated method works in arbitrary room geometries and primary source positions.},

  title = {On the {{Interdependence}} of {{Loudspeaker Motor Nonlinearities}}},
  abstract = {Two of the main nonlinearities in the electrodynamic loudspeaker are the position dependence of the force factor, Bl, and the voice coil inductance, Le. Since they both are determined by the geometry of the motor structure, they cannot be independent. This paper investigates this dependence both analytically and via FEM simulations. Under certain simplifying assumptions the force factor can be shown to be proportional to the spatial derivative of the inductance. Using FEM simulations the implications of this relation is illustrated for drivers with more realistic geometry and material parameters.},

  abstract = {We investigate sound field control based on the concept of sound zones for the mitigation of low frequency noise from outdoor concerts to the surrounding area by adding secondary loudspeakers to the existing primary sound system. The filters for the secondary loudspeakers are the result of an optimization problem that minimizes the total sound pressure level of both primary and secondary loudspeakers in a sensitive area and the impact of the secondary loudspeakers on the audience area of the concert. We report results from three different experiments with increasing complexity and scale. The sound field control system was reducing the sound pressure level in the dark zone on average by 10 dB below 1 kHz in a small scale experiment in anechoic conditions, by up to 14 dB in a controlled large scale open-air experiment and by up to 6 dB at a pilot test at a music festival.},

We outline the initial concept of a sound field control (SFC) system for tackling this issue using sound-zoning. The system uses Bayesian inference to update a sound propagation model. We present a simulation in which SFC and propagation model work together.},
